# Panda

### Description

The “Panda” website features a business analytics dashboard with panels showing total profit, a “Market Overview” graph, and performance metrics. The left-side menu includes options like ‘Dashboard,’ ‘Mail’, ‘Chat’ and other. The main section displays widgets for “Best Selling Products”, “Order Details”, and “Top Sellers”.

### Installing

Open Git Bash and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kkaazzuuukkii/Infocard.git

Than open this folder in Microsoft Visual Code or another area of development. Open terminal "PowerShell".
